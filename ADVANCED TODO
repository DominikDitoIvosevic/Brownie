A1. (4 pts) A basic grep command that matches lines containing a given string literal.
It should support the -v, -i, -o, -n and -c flags.


A2. (5 pts) Command piping. Using some special operator (for example |) hash should
be capable of chaining commands so that the output of one command is made input
into another.


A3. (3 pts) A basic chmod command for editing file and directory permissions. It should
take a rwx permission mask and a list of files and adjust their permissions. (Hint:
System.Posix.Files)


A4. (5 pts) Glob expansion of names in the shell.


A5. (8 pts) Some form of loops – while, for or foreach. Multiple loop implementations
are not scored separately.


A6. (8 pts) Forking processes. Some command or special operator should be capable of
starting another command in a new process. You also have to implement stopping
or killing the new process in some way.


A7. (3 pts) Implement a hexdump command that, given a file, prints out its byte contents
as hexadecimal numbers.


A8. (2 pts) Support .hashrc files. These files contain hash syntax that should be exe-
cuted before running a hash script or starting an interactive session. They should
be no matter in which directory hash is started – for example, always look in the
user’s home directory.


A9. (3 pts) Implement a ping command. It should perform the same task as a vanilla
(flagless) version of ping.
